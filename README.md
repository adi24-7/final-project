## Overview

### Description
Would allow students and school faculty members to keep track of the lost items at school in real time. Students can add a bounty to locate their lost item or add any items they found to the overall database. This way, students and teachers can observe the inventory of lost items from the comfort of their location and work together to find belongings.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Social
- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the instant logging of lost or found items. The camera is used to share an image of the items.
- **Story:** Students and teachers can observe the inventory of lost items from the comfort of their location and work together to find lost belongings. It would also result in a faster turn-out rate for the lost item as the app would push out a notification for when a lost item is reported and a student files a bounty.
- **Market:** Any school district or individual school could utilize this app. For younger demographics like elementary school, schools can install iPads in different areas and grant parents access to this app to use on behalf of the student. As for middle and high school students, most own a phone and could utilize this app directly.
- **Habit:** School faculty would monitor this app daily to see if the lost items are returned to the owner. Students would be checking daily to see if their item has been added to the inventory or found by another student.
- **Scope:** V1 would allow students to create a bounty for a lost product or add a lost item to the database. Additionally, it would be possible to view a list of all the items in the database. It could be tested in a school setting. V2 would allow the students to resolve the bounty and update the database appropriately. V3 would automatically categorize the pic uploaded into different categories of the database.
